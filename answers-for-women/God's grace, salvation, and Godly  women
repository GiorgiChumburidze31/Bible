## Feeling Unworthy of God's Love 

`"...but I never felt deserving of those sacraments, or his love, or his mercy"`

### *Jesus Christ as Sacrifice, and God's Love Towards Humans*



None of us are really deserving of love. If we look at **Romans 5:8** 

*"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."*

**Commendeth:** Means demonstrates and shows. God's love towards human beings is demonstrated through actions in the most sacrificial way, which led ultimatelly to his death. (Christ died for us)

This event happened `when the human race had nothing to offer,` there was so much sin in the world that God sent Jesus Christ upon the Earth to put our faith into him. 

 God and Jesus Christ both showed us their unconditional love when we had nothing to give. 

 * God choosing to send Jesus Christ as our saviour in human form 
 * Jesus Christ choosing to not use Godly powers on earth, live and sacrifice himself for us, humans. 

 ```
 Ephesians 2:8-9, Paul says to us:

"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast."

This means that that God chose to extend His love to us. This shows His love is not based on human merit, performance, or worthiness.
```

### God's Character By Nature not By Human Performance 

**1 John 4:8:** *"He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."*

The following verse means that God love us because it is `who he simply is, he loves,` not because of who `we` are. God is extremely `loyal` to the human race, even in times of defiance of his existance, he decided to send us his son to `redeem us.` 

**John 3:16** says this:
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."


**Isaiah 43:4:**
*"Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee."*

God sees value in us because He created us in His image and desires a relationship with us. He gave us the ability to be like him. 

When we feel unworthy, this can be due to lack of involvement with God in our lifes. We should look at this as an opportunity to lean into God's love and remember that our worth is defined by His view of us, not our own perceptions or failures.



## Growing In Relationship With God 



## Fear of Losing Salvation 

Salvation is a gift from God, not based on works or value, or performance of humans, and God is faithful to keep those who are His:

"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." `(John 10:27-28)`


"He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." `(Philippians 1:6)`
