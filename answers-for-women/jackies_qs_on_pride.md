### Item 1.

*connection to a girl in a coffee shop wearing a "self-love" shirt. (45-minute mark). He links self-love and pride. I don’t necessarily agree with this, and I'd like your thoughts on it.*

Let's address the following first. The reason why self love and pride are linked closely is because they go hand in hand with each other... `Self-love` **nowadays** is all about "me, me, I, mine, I am so important", which esentially turns into nothing but pride, and entitlement over others. 

Defying others, and putting yourself first, is **`not`** what God tells you to do.

The reason why he is linking self-love and pride together is because esentially self-love BECAME an aspect that exists and goes hand in hand with pride and pridefuleness in today's society. 

`Pride culture is a culture where humans are making themselves the greatest thing to exist, by using the aspect of self love.`



### Item 2.

*...To actually properly love yourself, in my thoughts, would be the equivalent of taking care of yourself as someone you are responsible for. For example, caring for your child (you would, in theory, not self-indulge in every pleasure or distract yourself from those life's responsibilities associated with that kid by making excuses—you would hold yourself accountable to those responsibilities).*

Before I get into it, I just want to say that you are **`absolutely right`** when it comes properly loving yourself and taking care of yourself as someone you are responsible for. 

* `1 Corinthians 6:19-20:` "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."

This means that taking care of yourself is a responsiblity that you owe to God, and the aspect of taking care of yourself should `never` drift into self-indulgence, or pride.

What you are describing above, I can add and bounce of some examples to is as well. 

* Going to the gym 
* Eating clean 
* Cleaning your room
* Paying your bills 
* Handling college assigments 
* Takig care of yourself as someoene you are responsible for
* Taking care of your child 


#### To exclude God, and talk about this from a social perspective...

The following are examples above of what it means to be a **`functioning adult,`** however, nowadays in society these acts are being labeled as being `strong, independent, and concurrently gets associeted with "lifes hardships."`This is because there are many low lives (Godless people) nowadays who simply struggle to perform these tasks. (excluding people with `actual` medical diagnosis who truly struggle with these things)

If performing duties that a `functioning adult` performs makes one to love themself more, it simply shows how they have barely experienced any `real` hardships in life. It should not be a `big deal` to perform all the examples listed above.


### Item 3. 

*To properly love yourself* 


Bible DOES say to love yourself but... 

* `Ephesians 5:29:` *"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church."*

Nourish means to let it grow, so this tells us that YES, take care of your body, protect it, sustain it, grow it and cherish it. Treat it with affection and care.

 Remember, when God originally created Adam and Eve, he also stated that one day a man would leave his mother and father and reunite as "one flesh" with her wife. So this applies to husband-wife taking care of each other as one flesh, together, if that makes sense...

 The following statement makes it clear that taking care of yourself is not selfish but it is part of God's plan by design. And it does not only include you, it includes your wife as well. 

But it also warns us against excessive self-love, which lead to pride, and sin 

* `Philippians 2:3:` *"Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves."*

* `2 Timothy 3:2:` *"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy."*

The following verse is actually a **`warning`** where there will be a time when people will "become excessively self-focused, prioritizing their desires and comfort above God and others. This "love of self" is not about healthy self-respect but about narcissism and selfish ambition."


What does it mean to properly love yourself? Again, Bible does adress this and tells you the following. 

* *`1 Corinthians 6:19-20:` "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."* 

light has no habitation with darkness.

* *`Ephesians 5:29:` "For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church."*

### Item 4. 

*and then by continuing to love someone else, means to be able to self-acknowledge and forgive every flaw, insecurity, and inner trauma, but at the same time, maintaining the want to grow and improve them. To be able to be at peace with where you are but not be complacent.*

### Forgiveness And Growth In Christ
---

Remember, forgiveness is not about `excusing sin,` but simply accepting God's grace and striving for holinesss. 

* 2 Corinthians 5:17: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."

True growth comes when we bring our brokenness before God and allow Him to transform us.

We are all sinners, we all have done wrong, question is, have we truly transformed after the regret and repentence of our past sins...?  Only after TRUE transformation we become new...

Also, remember, (this is not my biblical response), you can never truly grow and improve someone, you may plant a seed, but they have to be the ones to nourish it. 

### Balance, Ambition, Contentment
---

God encourages us with to always strive for better, but again, we must be very carefuly not to boast, brag, and be prideful about it.  

* `Philippians 3:13-14:` "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."

1. "Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended" - this means that we have yet to understand and fully achieve perfection of Christian likeness. This is humility which is necessary, because regardless of our spiritual maturity we never truly "arrive" or "finish" our journey.
