# Chapter 4 

## Chapter Summary and It's Teachings


In the following Chapter, we see Eve giving birth to the`first human on Earth, Abel.`Followed by Cain. 

Abel was a sheep keeper, and Can was a tiller of the ground. 

Abel and Cain both made offerings to God. God accepted Abel's offer, but declined Cains. This brought wroth upon Cain, leading him to the `murder of his brother, Abel.` 

* We see murder being commited due to jealousy 

God curses Cain, making him a wanderer, and the ground will no longer yield its strength to him. Cain fears his punishment, so God marks him to protect him from being killed by others. `Whoever kills Cain shall be punished sevenfold.`

Cain settles in the land of Nod and has descendants, including Enoch, after whom he names a city.

His lineage includes notable figures like Lamech, who introduces `polygamy` (having more than one wife) and speaks of `vengeance`.

Lamech is `boasting` to his wives about how he murdered two men, which is already showing pride and arrogance.

 Cain's murder was out of `fear and jealousy,` however `Lamech's was out of pride and arrogance` which is more far more concerning.

Then Lamech states that he should be avanged seventy-sevenfold, which again shows his pride and self importance. 

This is where Lamech gets it wrong. God's sevenfold "punishment" was actually mercy to Cain, so he would not get murdered, however Lamech clearly misinterperets this.  

## Verses
> **(Gen 4:1 KJV):** And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

What exactly does `"Adam knew Eve his wife"` mean? Did Adam not know his wife prior to the fall? How is `"know"` being implied here? 

> **(Gen 4:2 KJV):** `And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, **but** Cain was a tiller of the ground. 

The following phrase **"but Cain was a..."** makes it seem like Cain being a tiller made him seem the lesser person. Why is that? Why is the word "but" being used in here? Does Cain's `"lesserness"` foreshadow the murder of Abel? The word "lesser" is not being used to belittle Cain. It simply means that maybe Abel's job holds more responsibility/accountability than Cains.


We see Cain and Abel making offerings to God, God accepts Abel's offerings, and declines Cain's, Cain is not happy with this...

> **(Gen 4:7 KJV):**  If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. **And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.**

God here is **WARNING** Cain of `sin's desire to dominate and rule over him.`

God tells us that if we do not do well, (meaning if we are not good), then `sin` will lie within our soul. And sin will desire us, (sin will want to gravitate toward us), but in the end we `will` rule over sin. 

God does not say you `should` rule over sin, he says we `shall` rule over it, implying that it is inevitable.

>**(Gen 4:23 KJV):**  And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

- **"And Lamech said unto his wives":** We are already seeing deviation from God's original message in *Gen 2:24*, which is to become one flesh with one wife, not wives... 

- (Gen 2:24 KJV): Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.


>**(Gen 4:24 KJV):**  If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

This shows pride, and arrogance. 

> **(Gen 4:25 KJV):**  And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 

Again, we see the term "Knew his wife" being used again. Not sure why it is being used this way.
