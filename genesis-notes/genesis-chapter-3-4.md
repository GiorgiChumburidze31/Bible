## Chapter Summary 

In this chapter we see the `"SERPANT"` being introduced in the Bible. Serpant is defined as a `"subtil beast,"` which simply meant cunning, and decieving. 

Serpant succsesfully convinces Eve to eat the fruit from the tree that is in the midst of the garden. It is also important to note that Eve is the one who gets approached first, not Adam. We must remember that upon creation, Eve's job is to be a helper of Adam. 

> Gen 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

However, `Eve decides to make decisions without approaching Adam,` and the serpant also takes advantage of the woman in `absence of Adam by asking provocative questions.` Bringing fourth temptation. 

First issue is that Eve is alone. 

Second issue is that she twists God's words.

After the following, Eve also manages to get Adam to get a taste of the fruit, they both become aware of their nakedeness. They cover themselves up and decide to hide themselves from God. 

`(We see Adam and Eve disobeying God's strictly given orders by eating the forbidden fruit, which introduces sin into our current world)`

God finds about their actions, and decides to punish the woman and the man, each role recieveing their own punishment. Ultimatelly, Adam and Eve are both banished from the Garden of Eden.

### What was the issue from eating from the tree of knowledge of good and bad? 

The issue was that at the time of Adam and Eve's creation. `God was the only one who knew what good and evil was.`

 Humans still had the factor of choice, and were still like God in some sense. Again, God created a man in his image, not `COMPLETELY in his image.` 
 
 The issue with eating the tree of knowledge of good and evil was the fact that Adam and Eve tried to acquire something that God did not intend for them to have. 

When a human, takes the responsibility of deciding what's good and what's evil upon himself, this is where things go wrong.

### **Verse 12**
> *"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."*

- We already see Adam, the man blaming the woman for his actions. After consuming the tree of life, humans (in this case Adam specifically) begins to toss blame onto others (Eve), and fails to own up to his mistakes. 
---

### **Verse 13**
> *"And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."*

- God questions Eve, and she also deflects responsibility, blaming the serpent for deceiving her. Again we see the blame being passed on. 
---

### **Verse 15**
> *"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."*


- This verse, often called the *Protoevangelium* ("first gospel"), contains the first promise of redemption. It is foreshadowing that one day Jesus Christ will come upon earth.
- The "enmity" represents the ongoing struggle between humanity and Satan, as well as between good and evil.

- "Her seed" is a reference to Jesus Christ, who will ultimately defeat Satan ("bruise thy head"), a mortal blow, even though Satan will cause temporary suffering ("bruise his heel") through Christ’s crucifixion.

### **Verse 16**
> *"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."*

In this verse God is punishing the woman for her act by bringin sorrow and conception. This means that woman is already going to be impaired emotionally (sorrow) and physichally (conception). 

* Conception -> Childbearth, sex, penetration, etc. 
* Sorrow -> feeling of distress, regret, dejection, misery, painful experiences 




`...desire to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee`

ქართულ ბიბლიაში, ახალ აღთქმაში `DESIRE` არის ნახსენები როგორც ტოლვად. ანუ კაცდან თანაბრად ყოფნად, მაგრამ დღის ბოლოს იგი მაინც იბატონებს შენზე. 

ხოლო კი ძველ აღთქმაში იგი ნახსნებია "მიქცევაი" ანუ შეიძლება ითქვას რომ იგივე `DESIRE`...

The word `desire` has 2 interpertations 

*  It can mean longing or dependency on her husband, possibly reflecting a distorted dynamic introduced by sin.
* Can interpret this as a reference to a relational struggle or conflict, where the woman desires to control or dominate her husband.


We can clearly see that God is putting the man in the position to take charge and "RULE" over the woman. This does not mean that woman is inferior. It is their job to do so! 

**The Text: Ephesians 5:24 (KJV):**

22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

```
1. Submission in Marriage (Verses 22–24)

Definition of Submission: The Greek term for "submit" (hypotassō) carries the idea of willingly placing oneself under another’s leadership. It does not imply inferiority but order and cooperation within relationships.

As Unto the Lord: The submission is "as unto the Lord," indicating that this is part of a broader act of obedience to God, not blind subservience to the husband.

Husband as Head: The husband is described as the "head" of the wife, analogous to Christ as the head of the church. This headship involves responsibility and care, not domination.
